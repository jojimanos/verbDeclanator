## This Project

This is language learning tool for students and academics as well, with the aim to supply anytime anywhere the full declension of a verb in classical (attic) greek.

The project is built using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as a full stack framework. Later on, there will be a connection with database to match the irregular verbs and supply the needed elements for their declension.

The design is done using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
